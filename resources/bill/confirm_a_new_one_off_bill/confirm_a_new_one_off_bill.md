`resource_uri`
: The URI at which the new resource may be accessed via the API

`resource_id`
: The unique id of the create resource

`resource_type`
: The type of create resource. Accepts: bill, subscription or pre_authorizationsignatureA signature of the parametersstateThe state parameter passed in with the initial request if present

TODO:
- Add info about checking the signature
- Add info about POSTing the correct params back to GoCardless
